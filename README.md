# Auction-App
Auction App is a fully front-end interactive auction and straight-sale platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed as a portfolio project, it simulates real-world auction functionalities, showcasing dynamic dashboards, live bidding, and user/admin role management—all in a sleek dark-themed UI.

How It Works ⚡

Login:

Choose role: User or Admin.

Users can start bidding or buying; admins can manage items.

Auctions:

Click Place Bid to increase the current bid.

Bids are recorded live with username and timestamp.

Auction ends automatically when timer reaches zero; winner is displayed.

Straight Sale:

Add items to your cart.

Stock decreases in real-time, first 5 users get “charged”.

Dashboard:

View live bids, personal bid history, and winnings in dedicated sections.

Technologies Used 💻

HTML5 – Semantic markup for structure

CSS3 – Modern styling with dark theme & responsive layout

JavaScript – Dynamic DOM updates, live timers, bid tracking

Why This Project Stands Out 🚀

Demonstrates role-based user interaction and dynamic dashboards.

Realistic auction simulation for portfolio purposes.

Clean, modern UI/UX design with scrollable bid histories.

Fully front-end, interactive, and responsive, ready to showcase coding skills.
